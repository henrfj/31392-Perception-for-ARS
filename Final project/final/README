# Calibration

## TODO Part 1
* use the algorithms on the video (frame by frame)
* try to create an undistorted and rectified video (seperately)
* write documentation
* in case we will solve it live, it might be handy to create some wrapper function that can be easily called from main

## Changelog
* MM25.04.22: rewritten into jupyter & functions, corrected few bugs, changed to correct folder names

## v1
* undistortion and rectification working on testing data
* created folders undistorted, rectified, rectified-undistorted, undistorted-rectified
